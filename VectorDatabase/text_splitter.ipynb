    "# ‚úÖ What is Chunking?\n",
    "- Chunking = Splitting large documents (text, PDFs, webpages) into smaller parts or ‚Äúchunks‚Äù before generating embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "    a. A 100-page PDF ‚ûù split into 500 small chunks (paragraphs, sentences, etc.)\n",
    "    b. Each chunk ‚ûù converted to vector (embedding) ‚ûù stored in a vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# üîç Why and When to Perform Chunking ?\n",
    "    1. üìè Model Context Limitations\n",
    "        - üß† Chunking ensures that each piece fits into the model's max token size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. üöÄ Faster and More Accurate Retrieval\n",
    "        - ‚ÄúFast Retrieval‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Smaller chunks = finer-grained search.\n",
    "        - When a user asks a question, the retriever can fetch only the most relevant chunk, not an entire page or document.\n",
    "        - This increases accuracy and relevance of responses from the LLM.\n",
    "        - üìå Example: If you store full pages or full chapters, your retrieval may return too much irrelevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. üßÆ Optimizing Computational Resources\n",
    "        - ‚ÄúComputational Resources‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Embedding large chunks uses more memory and time.\n",
    "        - Embedding smaller chunks is faster and easier to batch-process.\n",
    "        - Vector search is also faster when each entry is smaller and semantically tight.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. üéØ Improving Semantic Representation\n",
    "        - ‚ÄúImprove the representation quality‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Large chunks often contain mixed topics, reducing embedding precision.\n",
    "        - Chunking helps isolate semantically consistent units, improving retrieval performance.\n",
    "        - Better representation = better search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why do we need the Chunking ?\n",
    "    1. Model Limitation. \n",
    "    2. Handle non-uniform document lenght. \n",
    "    3. Improve representation of data. \n",
    "    4. Cost Retrieval since chunk we can regulate. \n",
    "    5. Optimize the computational resources. \n",
